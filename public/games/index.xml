      <description>This game has been made for the Make something horrible 2018 gamejam.
The subject of the gamejam was to make, as the name subject, a horrible game. The theme of this year was: &amp;ldquo;What if the creators switched their games?&amp;rdquo;. For my game, I choosed Sid Meier (Civilization&amp;rsquo;s gamedesigner) with PUBG (a battleroyale game).
Funfact, it has been my first real game project that I actually finished: even though it has a very unusual graphic style and a very simple gameplay, I look back to this game fondly because I actually finished it on time.</description>
