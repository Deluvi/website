Hello! Welcome to my website!

My name is <span class="h-card"><img class="u-photo" src="/img/avatar-medium.png" style="display: none;"/><a href="https://deluvi.com" class="u-url p-name" rel="me">Deluvi</a></span>. I am a french computer science person that enjoy coding, video games and music.

If you want, you can try out [my games](/games). I have an [Itch.io account](https://deluvi.itch.io/) where I put the games.

I have also [a blog](/blog) where I write about anything (mostly about computer stuff).

Finally, my Github is [here](https://github.com/Deluvi). I usually put the source code of my games and projects there.
