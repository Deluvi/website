      <description>Hello people! This is Deluvi speaking. Welcome to my first blog post!
I have been inspired by the Indieweb movement to make my own website. I really like their ideas of owning our own data and content and not letting companies owning them for convenience&amp;rsquo;s sake, since it can be as simple to share on our own website with the help of modern tooling.
In this first blog post, I will share my current setup of this static website.</description>

      <description>This game has been made for the Make something horrible 2018 gamejam.
The subject of the gamejam was to make, as the name subject, a horrible game. The theme of this year was: &amp;ldquo;What if the creators switched their games?&amp;rdquo;. For my game, I choosed Sid Meier (Civilization&amp;rsquo;s gamedesigner) with PUBG (a battleroyale game).
Funfact, it has been my first real game project that I actually finished: even though it has a very unusual graphic style and a very simple gameplay, I look back to this game fondly because I actually finished it on time.</description>
