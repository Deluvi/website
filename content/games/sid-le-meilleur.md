summary: "When Civilization meets PUBG"
---

This game has been made for the [Make something horrible 2018](https://itch.io/jam/make-something-horrible-2018) gamejam.

The subject of the gamejam was to make, as the name subject, a horrible game. The theme of this year was: "What if the creators switched their games?". For my game, I choosed Sid Meier (Civilization's gamedesigner) with PUBG (a battleroyale game).

Funfact, it has been my first real game project that I actually finished: even though it has a very unusual graphic style and a very simple gameplay, I look back to this game fondly because I actually finished it on time.

Check out the game [here](https://deluvi.itch.io/cid-le-meilleurs-battleground).

The game has been made with Gamemaker. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/Deluvi/BRStrategy.gmx).
